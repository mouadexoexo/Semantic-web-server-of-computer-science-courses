##########################Introduction############################
In an educational establishment, a set of students grouped under a hierarchical structure (pathways, promotions, sections, groups, ...) are supposed to have a set of lessons that are repeated periodically, each of these teachings extends over a period of time, whose elementary unit is the period.
Resolving the problem of time use means assigning to each of these courses a number of consecutive periods equal to the duration it requires, a room of suitable type and capacity, and a teacher able to provide the module. concerned with teaching in order to prevent conflicts over teachers, students and locals. The problem of time use comes in different forms, each of which is specific to the environment or the institution. related thereto. In our case, the problem of the timetable studied is that of the university (computer science department) where the pedagogical managers need each year to establish a new planning of the different promotions by trying at best to satisfy the constraints. "Human" teachers and students, the educational constraints imposed by the progression of teaching and taking into account the "physical" constraints related to material resources (premises, equipment etc ...).
